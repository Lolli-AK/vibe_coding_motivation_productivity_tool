<Idea>
An app that works in the background of your laptop takes screenshots of what you are doing every 20 seconds with a timestamp. Then, after 5 minutes, AI analyzed the pictures and wrote 2-3 paragraphs on what a person did in the meantime. The final output is a message summarizing what the person did, how the person could improve, and a motivational message motivating a person. 
</Idea>
<Problem>
Employees have trouble tracking the work they have accomplished over the course of days or weeks. Employees are not motivated enough in their work. 
</Problem>
<Approach>
The screenshots (15 total) will get stored in a light database locally. The onboarding flow will be: the user is prompted to input the email that they want the output to be sent to. Then, the user is asked if they want to input a checklist of things that they want to get done. They can choose to skip this step. Then the app will run in the background and take a screenshot of the userâ€™s screen on a Mac, unbeknownst to the user. After 5 minutes the app will output a short summary of what the user did, according to what the AI sees on the screenshots.
